# decision-time-universality
A small study to observe the universality in Google search query durations.

This script makes Google search queries of randomly chosen words and records their durations into a file. 

## Usage
- Edit `duration.py` to set the number of words. 
- Run it via `python googledecisionduration.py`. 
- After it finishes you can plot the graph via `python duration_plot.py`.
